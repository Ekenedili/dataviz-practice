# Process and Wireframe
This week, I focused on wireframing my final presentation as well as getting feedback on how well my attempt translated to various people (user research).
I initially planned to do this by hand but last minute decided to try out balsamiq. Balsamiq was easier to use than I initially imagined so that was a big plus.

In preparartion for this, I watched presentations on mortality and also read reports on mortality to get an idea of common themes. My idea was to set up a mental moodboard of sorts so I could tailor my presentation. My biggest takeaway from here was that there was no common theme per se excpet that these presentations were somber. No standard color scheme or outline or anything of the sort. This gave me some freedom and I decided to do a cursory interview of my former colleagues in Nigeria.
I called 2 of them just to get an idea of whaat they would expect to hear in a presentation that plans to highlight under 5 mortality stats in the country and neither of them had any strong opinions on this. Both of them said they would like to know how bad the indices are from state-to-state and that wasn't something I had planned to include before so I took that into consideration. They also said they would like to see how Nigeria compared to a similar country in Africa (typically, Nigerian health stats are compared with Pakistan, Afghanistan and sometimes, India).

I took all these into account and started the wireframe on Balsamiq. Building on and tweaking my plans from part I, I decided to start somewhat innocuously. I highlighted 3 evengts I felt were most influential in bringing attention to child mortality rates as well as goals to reduce them. These events are 1) World Summit for Children in 1990, 2) Millenium Development Goals in 2000 and 3) Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. More specific details of these events are in the wireframe. I decided to show the overall world trend, then show that Nigeria has a similar downward trend but without comparison. My aim here is to establish a feel-good sentiment like "hey we are doing such a great job" before bringing in the comparison that shows how badly we are doing despite the downward trend. I am hoping this really acts as a hook for my audience and engages them even more.

Using advice from my pre-wireframe interviews, I decided to use a country similar to Nigeria for further comparison. I chose Ghana because of similarities like 1) location - West Africa 2) colonized by the British just like Nigeria so certain similarity in cultures and independence gained at around the same time 3) similar disease epidemiology - malaria and other infectious diseases that contribute to child mortality 4) similar homogenous black populations 5) similar GDP, also a lower-middle-income country.

This is what my wireframe looked like(I am attaching screenshots because I did it on Balsamiq Desktop and I cannot quite figure out how to share):














# User Research Protocol
a) My intended audience is the Minister of Health so I asked a friend who works in the Ministry who would typically sit in on such a presentation. I was told the Minister's PA and other departments like communication, public health b) so I decided on 1) a doctor who works in public health 2) a communications expert who makes health-related content 3) an American classmate (to get an idea of how a non-Nigerian audience may receive the content). I also asked 3 other people I selected at random to serve as a random audience that may come across my project.
c) My interview script was:
Hi!
I am working on a project to highlight child mortality specifically under-5 mortality in Nigeria; our performance over the years and how we are doing compared to others.

I am attaching a wireframe/rough outline of my work and I'd love to hear your feedback. Pls note that THE NUMBERS ARE NOT EXACT AND ARE JUST A ROUGH APPROXIMATION TO DRIVE THE POINT HOME.
a) After looking at the visuals, what do you notice?
b) What confuses you the most?
c) What would you like me to change? (colour, style of visualization)
d) What would you like me to include?
e) What would you like me to remove/ take out?
f) If you had to summarize this presentation in a sentence, what would you say?
I am open to any other suggestions, insights, criticisms you would like to offer.

Thank you so much for your time!
## Findings
## Interviewee #1, Medical Doctor, works in Public Health
a)	The figures in Nigeria have improved progressively although it’s remained worse than the world average. The improvement seems to have slowed between 2015-2019.
b)	I am not confused by anything.
c)	I think you should be consistent in the color scheme e.g: grey for world, blue for Ghana and red for Nigeria. You may also want to change one of your bar charts to a line graph; too many bar charts. You can also consider leaving Nigeria as the second bar in both comparisons for uniformity.
d)	You may have forgotten but please, add titles and axis labels to your plots. I would also like to see how much of the world child deaths Nigeria contributes to if that’s possible.
e)	You don’t need to take out anything
f)	Pls see a)
## Interviewee #2, Comms expert that makes health-related content
 Use the same bar colors across. In the first image, the global U-5 mortality rate was represented with a blue color and Nigeria was represented with a lavender color. Please, let that be consistent across the entire thing, this means that Ghana’s color will change
Red might be best for Nigeria because it’s the country with the most problems.
In the last frame where you mention Ogun state as the best performing state, I didn’t see anywhere in the doc that you established that Nigeria had 36 states to begin with.
Ogun performed best, out of how many. And what was the U-5 mortality rate there and how does that compare to the global average in 2018 as well?

## Interviewee #3, food & nutrition expert looking to specialize in child nutrition
I understand that there was a concerted effort by the world to reduce child mortality and initially, I thought Nigeria was doing so well but when I saw the comparison, I was surprised at how bad we are doing. 
I like the Ghana comparison a lot. I also like the line chart with Ghana, World Average and Nigeria. I would have loved to see comparisons with more countries; is that possible? I think you should maintain the same color for all the countries. I like that you highlighted that there was no accurate data available on a sub-national level because I was curious as to how individual states were faring.The red is too red? Like neon?
Nigeria’s figures are very bad. 1 in 8 children die before their 5th birthday? That’s too much.

## Interviewee #4, classmate
a) I noticed bar graphs with different color schemes.  
b) After the first data visualization, the rest of the viz did not have titles so it made it a little difficult to ascertain what the graph was trying to say
c) It would be good to have a consistent color scheme throughout the whole storyboard! Also, add titles to the data visualizations
d) It may be good to include a "hook" part in the beginning because you do start out with a bunch of information in the first slide. It would be good to ease the audience into your story
e) It may be best to not get too wordy with the content in your storyboard as it makes it difficult for the audience to get in your story. Having bullet points would definitely help! 
f) Nigeria still has a lot to accomplish in terms of child mortality under the ages of 5 years old when compared to other countries
It would be best to include what your final call to action is specifically. What can we do about the decreasing child mortality rates in Nigeria?? Also, I am guessing that your audience is aimed at policymakers in Nigeria or? Also for the "Under 5 Mortality" part, you can visually represent the target goal with a progress bar on Balsamiq. There are many icons and tools that can help make it more visually apparent than words.

## Interviewee #5, classmate
a) The visuals seem very apt for the data you're presenting. The color seemed very indicative of what is being highlighted and needs more focus and the color for the comparisons also made sense. I like the question at the bottom to lead the flow of thought process.
b) The purple visualization initially throws me off because the rest is mostly red and blue. 
c) I would change the purple color to something that you can keep consistent to stand for Nigeria maybe a maroon. I also would change the shade of red and blue that you used to keep them consistent and less bright because it can look like neon with different brightness levels. 
d) For the comparison visualization, maybe include a title that describes the observations so then the visualization can stand by itself and still make sense. For the 1 in 8 statistic with the children, maybe you can use icons for the children instead of the picture you have now and color in the child who wouldn't survive because the cross looks too harsh right now. I would also include a separate slide for call to action even if it is a small call to action because that will bring it more attention. 
e) I would remove a few words from the first slide because the SDG and MDG can be more concise to reduce the time to read the words on the slide.
f) While the Under 5 mortality rate is decreasing in Nigeria, it continues to stay high compared to the world and similar countries. 

## Interviewee #6, classmate
I notice a few bar charts
I am confused by the acronyms that are used in the slide for Under 5 Mortality. What was the reason for comparing Nigeria to Ghana? Do they have similar populations and public health issues? what is the call to action?
I think picking a color theme would be nice and using a different type of visualization for one of the bar charts would add variety. I would change the way you crossed out a child in one of the visualizations, I don't know if that's appropriate. Maybe use color to highlight them or make the other children in the visualization have some color.
I would include reasoning for comparison to Ghana and have a slide for the call to action itself. Include reasons for why child mortality has reduced and how those factors can continue reducing mortality       
I think you could remove the red X on the child in one of the visualizations
This story depicts Nigeria's progress in reducing infant/under 5 mortality.

Before implementing this feedback, I also showed 2 classmates in the breakout room during class and salient points from their feedback:'too many bar charts, maybe make all of them one bar chart" "I really like the picture where you crossed out a child"

### Common issues
After reading the feedback, I realized that while screenshotting my visuals for the wireframe, I cut out important information like title of the visualization and axis labels.

I used too many bar charts.

I need to stick with one color scheme.

I should consider a different way of showing that 1 in 8 children die.

I should consider toning down the intensity of the colors I used especially the red.

## Moving On...

I am going to move to Shorthand to start the actual storytelling. I will ensure published data has the titles as well axis labels (this is in the actual data visualization) I will also play around with a group of line charts to show the general trend then an interactive bar chart for the comparisons. I am also leaning towards 2 calls to action: 1) To implement the UN/WHO guidelines to reduce child mortality and 2) To collect accurate data locally. I also want to try to see how else I can say that 1 in 8 children will die; maybe desaturate the color of one of the eight children instead of crossing out. I will also retain the technical introduction since this is a technical presentation but I will try to personalize it in my presentation to the class and gloss over more technical/specialized aspects.
