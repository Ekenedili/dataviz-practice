# The End
This is the concluding part of my project process. Whew!

Following up from part 2, I had some work to do such as creating my presentation on Shorthand, finding related pictures/visuals, implementing the following changes:
1. Reducing the number of bar charts
2. Implementing a uniform color scheme
3. Toning down the neon effect of the colors I used
4. Ensure that I include titles/legends of my charts
5. Change the depiction I used in "1 in 8 children die".
**What I did not change**
For the most part, I implemented these changes however, I did not change the picture I used to represent that 1 in 8 children died. This is because I wanted it to be a harsh representation of the reality; I also kept the red because it fits in with my use of red for Nigeria's statistics.

Keeping my final audience in mind (the Minister of health who is also a medical doctor), I tried to use relevant imagery with minimal fuss and I tried to use darker colors so the presentation is somber. I also made sure my visualizations were very easy to follow and couldconvey my point even if one does not pay attention to the text.

My hardest design decision was:
*Color*: I was trying to be mindful of colorblind people and not use red and green in my visualization. I read up about how to contrast colors and my take-away was opposite colors on a color wheel are best for contrasting. I used blue VS orange and purple VS yellow and I thought red VS green looked best. I realized it could be my bias and reached out to a handful of friends who are also medical doctors and they kicked very strongly against the other color schemes; they felt only red and green had the required gravitas to pass across such weighty information. 
Eventually, I went with these colors because I needed to make that dichotomy of bad and good and red and green are intuitive and the other color schemes I tried like blue vs pink did not pack as much punch. That was a major compromise I had to make; disablilty consideration VS passing the message across easily. This was an important eye-opener because I used to think 'well, just use other colors if some people cannot see red and green'.

Other design decisions I had to make were to decide when to use bar charts VS line charts. For instance, comparing projected (desired) and actual under 5 mortality rates, I considered a line chart however, the projected rates were in 'time jumps' and so the line chart looked very clunky and not at all nice so I decided on a bar chart which looked so much better. 
The line chart race I used to compare Nigeria/Ghana/World Average statistics was a much better option than just using a line chart. It made it easier to appreciate how Ghana is close to closing the gap and how Nigeria is doing so poorly.

I had serious limitations in my attempt to obtain sub-national data to depict the variations within the country and I planned to use a map of Nigeria to show the variations.

In conclusion, another important takeaway from this project was flexibility. I was able to stick to my original plan of ensuring an informative presentation that was very to the point. However, the data I ended up using differed from my oroginal plan. I need to spend time familiarizing myself with othe rmethods of visualization as I limited myself to Flourish because I was most comfortable with it.
