# The End
This is the concluding part of my project process. Whew!

Following up from part 2, I had some work to do such as creating my presentation on Shorthand, deciding on my call to action, finding related pictures/visuals, implementing the following changes:
1. Reducing the number of bar charts
2. Implementing a uniform color scheme
3. Toning down the neon effect of the colors I used
4. Ensure that I include titles/legends of my charts
5. Change the depiction I used in "1 in 8 children die".


**What I did not change**
For the most part, I implemented these changes however, I did not change the picture I used to represent that 1 in 8 children died. This is because I wanted it to be a harsh representation of the reality; I also kept the red because it fits in with my use of red for Nigeria's statistics.

Keeping my final audience in mind (the Minister of health who is also a medical doctor), I tried to use relevant imagery with minimal fuss and I tried to use darker colors so the presentation is somber. I also made sure my visualizations were very easy to follow and couldconvey my point even if one does not pay attention to the text.

My hardest design decision was:

***Color***: I was trying to be mindful of colorblind people and not use red and green in my visualization. I read up about how to contrast colors and my take-away was opposite colors on a color wheel are best for contrasting. I used blue VS orange and purple VS yellow but I thought red VS green looked best and I really wanted to use red to denote Nigeria's statistics. I reached out to a handful of friends who are also medical doctors and they felt red and green had the required gravitas to pass across such weighty information. A more important factor was the need to emphasize that dichotomy of bad and good and red and green are intuitive and the other color schemes I tried like blue vs pink did not pack as much punch. That was a major compromise I had to make; disablilty consideration VS passing the message across easily. This was an important eye-opener because I used to think 'well, just use other colors if some people cannot see red and green'.

Other design decisions I had to make were to decide when to use bar charts VS line charts. For instance, comparing projected (desired) and actual under 5 mortality rates, I considered a line chart however, the projected rates were in 'time jumps' and so the line chart looked very clunky and not at all nice so I decided on a bar chart which looked so much better.

The line chart race I used to compare Nigeria/Ghana/World Average statistics was a much better option than just using a line chart which was my original choice. It made it easier to appreciate how Ghana is close to closing the gap and how Nigeria is doing so poorly.

I used a radial chart to compare Nigeria with Iceland (worst perfoming country and best performing country respectively). I could have used a bar chart here (and I did initially) but the radial chart gave a more holistic view of the differences and broke up the monotony of only using two types of charts.

Overall, I ensured that the most important visuals could be played with to catch attention of my listeners (and I think it worked because I got messages from people asking how I did it). So, the bar chart comparing the World Average and Nigeria can show either and both. This made my comparison more obvious. The line chart race was also captivating and the radial charts could be superimposed on each other. I wanted something where my audience can play with the visualizations when they have access to the presentation. 

I had serious limitations in my attempt to obtain sub-national data to depict the variations within the country and I planned to use a map of Nigeria to show the variations. This was one of my calls to action; we need better data. It's hard to offer any recommendations when we don't even know how things are at a sub-national level.

I made all my visualizations on Flourish because I was most comfortable with it. 

That's pretty much my process for this final part. I also tried to get feedback from different people (classmates in the TSWD class, people in the field, random people) on every single visualization. I sent just the visualization with no supporting text to get a good idea of how the visualization translates and the feedback was overwhelmingly in line with what I was trying to convey so it just reaffirmed that I was on the right track. 

The best thing I learned in this class and from the workbook/textbook was to let the data be captivating to the audience and also intuitive without my audience having to read the text. I think I was able to achieve both with the visualizations I used.
