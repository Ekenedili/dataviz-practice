# Part I - Final Project

## Overview
I plan to write my project about child mortality rates in Nigeria. The aim is to starkly present the data and use a few comparisons to drive home the point. We are aware that the indices are bad but I'm hoping my visualization and story will be able to show just how bad and create more of an impact e .g: the difference between **hearing** we have the worst mortality rates in the world vs **seeing** that our rates are twice the world average.

## Outline

### Introduction

 This will contain my **hook statement** (1 in 8 children in Nigeria die before their 5th birthday, ![Image](/dataviz-practice/1%20in%208.jpg)) and I will segue into why I am interested in child mortality (**a personal story**). I will end this section by giving a broad overview of terms as it relates to my presentation.
 
Body
------------
   This is the bulk of the presentation and I want it to be more visualization heavy. Here, I plan to show 4 broad things: 1) Current Nigeria and world statistics 2) The world average and Nigeria trends since 1960 3) Comparison with another sub-Saharan African country(SSA) and lower middle income country(LMIC). I have decided to go with Ghana for this because of the many similarities(homogenous black population, colonized by the British, gained independence about the same time).
   
   **Wireframes** are a little unfinished and you can see them below. I already ruled out area charts because they will not work for this visualization and I'm leaning towards grouped bar charts or line charts for the comparisons and I want them to be animated (still exploring that option).

  **Tentative Plan:**  I want to use an interactive dashboard so maybe an inital line graph of world average, then I will add 2-3 unlabelled lines and ask the audience to guess which is Nigeria. I will then show the line representing Nigeria. I will add in Ghana and for empasis, I will use a grouped bar chart to show all three (world average, Ghana and NIgeria)
   
   
  
Summary
------------
   I will recap my points and include a final call to action at the end. I'm still undecided on what the final call to action will be but I'm thinking something along the lines of strengthening health systems or implementing current WHO guidelines more forcefully.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   **Data** is from [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT?end=2019&start=1960&view=chart), [UNICEF](https://data.unicef.org/country/nga/), [Nigeria Demographic Health Survey](https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/who-and-nigerian-government-collaborate-curtail-child-mortality-country). These sources are linked and in some cases, I extracted the data and created an excel document so it's easier for me and I can work with the relevant years.
  
   **Method and Medium:** Currently, I hope to use Shorthand for my final presentation because I really want it to be like a story and I want my visualizations to tell the main story. The content is dark and heavy and I hope using a platform like Shorthand will help me keep it interestng long enough to get my point across. I want to be able to keep elements from my actual presentations like asking the audience to guess which line represents Nigeria (explained above). I plan to use **Tableau** and **Flourish** to create my visualizations.
