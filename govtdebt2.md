This is another visualization of government debt but this time in a a line chart, well, a grid of line charts.

Lastly, here I played around with the different chart templates available on Flourish. The area charts were very bad for the visualization; basically a sea of color with no specificity and it was impossible to identify the various countries. The stacked column/bar charts were so clunky and harsh on the eyes; just bars and bars. I ended up with a scatter plot which is quite similar to the sparklines we used.

I believe that these kinds of data comparing numbers over time for numerous entities are best represented by sparklines or scatterplots (a grid of scatter plots). I checked a couple of websites similar to the OECD (World Bank, UN) and it does seem like sparklines or grids of scatter plots are the go-to to compare indices over time across multiple entities. Overall, these visualization methods are way better than the bar chart as is in my original visual [here](https://ekenedili.github.io/dataviz-practice/govtdebt1). This is because the bar charts are only from one moment in time and are not as dynamic as these two methods.
My overall preferrred is the sparkline. I think it looks best (of all three).

For the visualizations on this page, the data is from [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) and it gives the total debt of the various countries as a percentage of the GDP of that country. The lower the value, the better; a country with a low debt-to-gdp ratio can sell goods or services and service their debts without going into more debt.
