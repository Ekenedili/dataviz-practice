# Welcome!
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me
My name is Ekene and I am a medical doctor trying to get a Master's degree in Healthcare Policy and Management. I am taking a course in Data Visualization called Telling Stories With Data

# What I hope to learn
At the end of this course, I want to have a good foundation in data visualization skills. I want to be a part of healthcare policy and healthcare decision making and I believe that telling convincing stories with data will be an invaluable skill.

# Portfolio
I am new to all of this but here's where you can find all my *cool* attempts at visualizing data!
