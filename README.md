# Welcome!
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me
My name is Ekene and I am a medical doctor in the Healthcare Policy and Management track at Heinz College. I am from Nigeria and prior to the start of this Master's program, the most tech-y thing I'd done was tweeting a lot!


I hope to write health policy someday but before then, I want to work in healthcare consulting. I am passionate about increasing quality of healthcare, reducing costs and reducing healthcare disparities.
In an alternate universe, I'd be a pediatric surgeon or maybe an anthropologist or a chef but in this universe, I want to harness data to drive healthcare decisions.


# What I hope to learn
At the end of this course, I want to have a good foundation in data visualization skills. I want to be a part of healthcare policy and healthcare decision making and I believe that telling convincing stories with data will be invaluable in my career path.

Fun fact: I'm writing this on 2/8/2021 and I've had only three classes **BUT** I'm already a lot more conscious of how I use color on my Instagram stories and I'm not even creating content! (*just sharing my unsolicited opinion on things that don't concern me*)

# Portfolio
I am new to all of this but here's where you can find all my *definitely* **cool** attempts at visualizing data!
