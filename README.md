# Welcome!
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me
My name is Ekene and I am a medical doctor in the Healthcare Policy and Management track at Heinz College. I am from Nigeria and prior to the start of this Master's program, the most tech-y thing I'd done was tweeting a lot!
I hope to write health policy someday but before then, I want to work in healthcare consulting. I am passionate about increasing quality of healthcare, reducing costs and reducing healthcare disparities.
In an alternate universe, I'd be a pediatric surgeon or maybe an anthropologist or a chef but in this universe, I want to harness data to drive healthcare decisions.


# What I hope to learn
At the end of this course, I want to have a good foundation in data visualization skills. I want to be a part of healthcare policy and healthcare decision making and I believe that telling convincing stories with data will be an invaluable skill.

# Portfolio
I am new to all of this but here's where you can find all my *cool* attempts at visualizing data!
