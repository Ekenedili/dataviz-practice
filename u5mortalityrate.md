I am attempting to visualize data from UNICEF and the World Bank about the world average U-5 mortality rates. [See original here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)

This is a relatively simple visualization (I think). I chose to re-do this because at first glance, the graph was a little misleading to me and this is despite my experience and understanding of these figures.
I realized that starting the y-axis of the graph at 40 instead of 0 made it seem like there was no U-5 mortality in the world after 2015 and that was shocking because I know for a fact that some countries in sub-saharan Africa still have really bad [figures](https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/who-and-nigerian-government-collaborate-curtail-child-mortality-country#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Nigeria%20Demographic,reach%20the%20age%20of%205.).
I also felt that having 1960-2019 on the x-axis was a little confusing since the data started from 1990.

I decided to rework this visualization using a bar chart because it's very easy to understand and still conveys the information that these figures have been consistently reducing over time. I also kept aspects I liked from the original visualization such as the dates in increments of 5 years.

I am worried about the fact that the most recent year should be 2020 however, the data ends at 2019.

I shared the sketch with a few people and the feedback was largely positive in terms of ease and getting a 'truer' picture. However, my sketch did not properly define that the rates were in terms of 1000. I was also advised to change the original title I used.

I reworked the sketch and used Flourish to create my new visualization. I think I like it.
