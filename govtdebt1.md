# Visualizing Govt Debt I

Here is my attempt at visualizing government debt as a percentage of GDP. The data is from the OECD website and it's data from 2019.

The countries I highlighted are countries of interest to me; I live there or I have family there or I hope to visit someday or even live there!

Enjoy the visualization.
